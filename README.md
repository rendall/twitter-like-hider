Twitter puts tweets in your feed that someone else 'likes' or 'follows', or suggests 'topics'. This extension allows you to hide those and other similar tweets.

Twitter changed its code, which caused unwanted tweets to show. This update fixes those.

<details>
<summary>Previous changes</summary>

### New in 1.6.2

Added 'Suggested Topics' to options. Checking 'Topics' will hide Twitter's "suggested topics" sections

### Bugfix 1.6.1

- The extension worked only for 'Dim' background mode. This fix allows for 'Default' and 'Lights Out' modes as well.
  - Other minor fixes:
  - Announce that 'Enable debug mode' is ON (if so) and inform user how to turn it off (in browser console).
  - Remove extraneous unused variable assignment.

### New in release 1.6

- Options! Right-click on the extension icon, select 'Options'.
  - This shows a list of the types of Twits the 'Twitter Like Hider' can hide. Check a box to show them, _un_-check a box to hide them.
  - Options are stored locally on the computer's browser
- Expands the types of Twits that can be hidden:
  - 'Likes'
  - 'Follows'
  - 'Retweeted'
  - 'Received a reply'
  - 'Replied'
- Rudimentary troubleshooting or 'debug' mode, enabled via options

### New in release 1.5

Twitter made the mistake of showing me 'like' and 'follows' Twits again, so I jumped on updating this immediately to hide the new Twits. I made it easier to update this in future and this version should eliminate the minute-long pause before the Twits are hidden
